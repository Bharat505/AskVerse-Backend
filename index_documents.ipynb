      "The latest Beta release can be found with the @beta tag, and daily experimental releases with @experimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler is a new compiler that we've open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the Rules of React, so you don't need to rewrite any code to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler also includes an ESLint plugin that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler is currently released as beta, and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta:\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, if you're using Yarn:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not using React 19 yet, please see the section below for further instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the compiler do? {/what-does-the-compiler-do/}\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don't need to recompute if their inputs haven't changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it's easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don't have any meaningful changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React's rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? {/what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on improving update performance (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping cascading re-rendering of components\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-rendering <Parent /> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <Parent /> has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, calling expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() inside of your component or hook that needs that data\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimizing Re-renders {/optimizing-re-renders/}\n",
      "\n",
      "React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component's state changes, React will re-render that component and all of its children — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with useMemo(), useCallback(), or React.memo(). For example, in the following example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList>'s state changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "javascript function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length === 0) { return <NoFriends />; } return ( <div> <span>{onlineCount} online</span> {friends.map((friend) => ( <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ))} <MessageButton /> </div> ); } See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as \"fine-grained reactivity\". In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <FriendListCard /> can be reused even as friends changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX and avoid re-rendering <MessageButton> as the count changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive calculations also get memoized {/expensive-calculations-also-get-memoized/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler can also automatically memoize for expensive calculations used during rendering:\n",
      "\n",
      "```js // Not memoized by React Compiler, since this is not a component or hook function expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() { / ... / }\n",
      "\n",
      "// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a component function TableContainer({ items }) { // This function call would be memoized: const data = expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects(items); // ... } ``` See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects is truly an expensive function, you may want to consider implementing its own memoization outside of React, because:\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler only memoizes React components and hooks, not every function\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler's memoization is not shared across multiple components or hooks\n",
      "\n",
      "So if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects was used in many different components, even if the same exact items were passed down, that expensive calculation would be run repeatedly.

      "What does the compiler do? {/what-does-the-compiler-do/}\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don't need to recompute if their inputs haven't changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it's easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don't have any meaningful changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React's rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? {/what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on improving update performance (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping cascading re-rendering of components\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-rendering <Parent /> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <Parent /> has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, calling expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() inside of your component or hook that needs that data\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimizing Re-renders {/optimizing-re-renders/}\n",
      "\n",
      "React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component's state changes, React will re-render that component and all of its children — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with useMemo(), useCallback(), or React.memo(). For example, in the following example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList>'s state changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "javascript function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length === 0) { return <NoFriends />; } return ( <div> <span>{onlineCount} online</span> {friends.map((friend) => ( <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ))} <MessageButton /> </div> ); } See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as \"fine-grained reactivity\". In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <FriendListCard /> can be reused even as friends changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX and avoid re-rendering <MessageButton> as the count changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive calculations also get memoized {/expensive-calculations-also-get-memoized/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler can also automatically memoize for expensive calculations used during rendering:\n",

      "// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a component function TableContainer({ items }) { // This function call would be memoized: const data = expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects(items); // ... } ``` See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects is truly an expensive function, you may want to consider implementing its own memoization outside of React, because:\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler only memoizes React components and hooks, not every function\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler's memoization is not shared across multiple components or hooks\n",
      "\n",
      "So if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects was used in many different components, even if the same exact items were passed down, that expensive calculation would be run repeatedly.

      "  \"answer\": \"To secure your Spark cluster, it's important to enable security features, which are not enabled by default. Evaluate your environment and the deployment type you are using, and take appropriate measures. Here are some key areas to consider:\\n\\n*   **Authentication:** Spark supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Enable it by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter. The mechanism to generate and distribute the secret is deployment-specific. For YARN, Spark handles this automatically, relying on YARN RPC encryption. For Kubernetes, Spark also generates a unique authentication secret for each application, propagated to executor pods using environment variables. You can also mount authentication secrets using files and Kubernetes secrets.\\n*   **Long-Running Applications:** For long-running applications, use a keytab or ticket cache for automatic token renewal to avoid issues with maximum delegation token lifetime. This is supported on YARN and Kubernetes.\\n*   **Event Logging:** If using event logging, ensure the directory where event logs are stored (`spark.eventLog.dir`) has proper permissions.\\n*   **Driver Logs in Client Mode:** If persisting driver logs in client mode, ensure the directory where the driver logs go (`spark.driver.log.dfsDir`) is created manually with proper permissions.\\n*   **Standalone Mode:** For clusters using the standalone resource manager, access to the hosts and ports used by Spark services should be limited to origin hosts that need to access the services.\\n\\nAlso, remember to secure the log files by setting the directory permissions to `drwxrwxrwxt` and setting the owner and group of the directory to correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server. This allows all users to write to the directory but prevents unprivileged users from reading, removing, or renaming a file unless they own it.\",\n",

      "To secure your Spark cluster, it's important to enable security features, which are not enabled by default. Evaluate your environment and the deployment type you are using, and take appropriate measures. Here are some key areas to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Authentication:** Spark supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Enable it by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter. The mechanism to generate and distribute the secret is deployment-specific. For YARN, Spark handles this automatically, relying on YARN RPC encryption. For Kubernetes, Spark also generates a unique authentication secret for each application, propagated to executor pods using environment variables. You can also mount authentication secrets using files and Kubernetes secrets.\n",
      "*   **Long-Running Applications:** For long-running applications, use a keytab or ticket cache for automatic token renewal to avoid issues with maximum delegation token lifetime. This is supported on YARN and Kubernetes.\n",
      "*   **Event Logging:** If using event logging, ensure the directory where event logs are stored (`spark.eventLog.dir`) has proper permissions.\n",
      "*   **Driver Logs in Client Mode:** If persisting driver logs in client mode, ensure the directory where the driver logs go (`spark.driver.log.dfsDir`) is created manually with proper permissions.\n",
      "*   **Standalone Mode:** For clusters using the standalone resource manager, access to the hosts and ports used by Spark services should be limited to origin hosts that need to access the services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, remember to secure the log files by setting the directory permissions to `drwxrwxrwxt` and setting the owner and group of the directory to correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server. This allows all users to write to the directory but prevents unprivileged users from reading, removing, or renaming a file unless they own it.\n"
