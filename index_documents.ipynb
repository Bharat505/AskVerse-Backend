      "The latest Beta release can be found with the @beta tag, and daily experimental releases with @experimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler is a new compiler that we've open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the Rules of React, so you don't need to rewrite any code to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler also includes an ESLint plugin that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler is currently released as beta, and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta:\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, if you're using Yarn:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not using React 19 yet, please see the section below for further instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the compiler do? {/what-does-the-compiler-do/}\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don't need to recompute if their inputs haven't changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it's easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don't have any meaningful changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React's rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? {/what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on improving update performance (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping cascading re-rendering of components\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-rendering <Parent /> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <Parent /> has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, calling expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() inside of your component or hook that needs that data\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimizing Re-renders {/optimizing-re-renders/}\n",
      "\n",
      "React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component's state changes, React will re-render that component and all of its children — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with useMemo(), useCallback(), or React.memo(). For example, in the following example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList>'s state changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "javascript function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length === 0) { return <NoFriends />; } return ( <div> <span>{onlineCount} online</span> {friends.map((friend) => ( <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ))} <MessageButton /> </div> ); } See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as \"fine-grained reactivity\". In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <FriendListCard /> can be reused even as friends changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX and avoid re-rendering <MessageButton> as the count changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive calculations also get memoized {/expensive-calculations-also-get-memoized/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler can also automatically memoize for expensive calculations used during rendering:\n",
      "\n",
      "```js // Not memoized by React Compiler, since this is not a component or hook function expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() { / ... / }\n",
      "\n",
      "// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a component function TableContainer({ items }) { // This function call would be memoized: const data = expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects(items); // ... } ``` See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",

      "What does the compiler do? {/what-does-the-compiler-do/}\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don't need to recompute if their inputs haven't changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it's easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don't have any meaningful changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React's rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? {/what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add/}\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on improving update performance (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping cascading re-rendering of components\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-rendering <Parent /> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <Parent /> has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Optimizing Re-renders {/optimizing-re-renders/}\n",
      "\n",
      "React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component's state changes, React will re-render that component and all of its children — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with useMemo(), useCallback(), or React.memo(). For example, in the following example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList>'s state changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "javascript function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length === 0) { return <NoFriends />; } return ( <div> <span>{onlineCount} online</span> {friends.map((friend) => ( <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ))} <MessageButton /> </div> ); } See this example in the React Compiler Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as \"fine-grained reactivity\". In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <FriendListCard /> can be reused even as friends changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX and avoid re-rendering <MessageButton> as the count changes.\n",

      "  \"answer\": \"To secure your Spark cluster, it's important to enable security features, which are not enabled by default. Evaluate your environment and the deployment type you are using, and take appropriate measures. Here are some key areas to consider:\\n\\n*   **Authentication:** Spark supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Enable it by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter. The mechanism to generate and distribute the secret is deployment-specific. For YARN, Spark handles this automatically, relying on YARN RPC encryption. For Kubernetes, Spark also generates a unique authentication secret for each application, propagated to executor pods using environment variables. You can also mount authentication secrets using files and Kubernetes secrets.\\n*   **Long-Running Applications:** For long-running applications, use a keytab or ticket cache for automatic token renewal to avoid issues with maximum delegation token lifetime. This is supported on YARN and Kubernetes.\\n*   **Event Logging:** If using event logging, ensure the directory where event logs are stored (`spark.eventLog.dir`) has proper permissions.\\n*   **Driver Logs in Client Mode:** If persisting driver logs in client mode, ensure the directory where the driver logs go (`spark.driver.log.dfsDir`) is created manually with proper permissions.\\n*   **Standalone Mode:** For clusters using the standalone resource manager, access to the hosts and ports used by Spark services should be limited to origin hosts that need to access the services.\\n\\nAlso, remember to secure the log files by setting the directory permissions to `drwxrwxrwxt` and setting the owner and group of the directory to correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server. This allows all users to write to the directory but prevents unprivileged users from reading, removing, or renaming a file unless they own it.\",\n",

      "*   **Authentication:** Spark supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Enable it by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter. The mechanism to generate and distribute the secret is deployment-specific. For YARN, Spark handles this automatically, relying on YARN RPC encryption. For Kubernetes, Spark also generates a unique authentication secret for each application, propagated to executor pods using environment variables. You can also mount authentication secrets using files and Kubernetes secrets.\n",
      "*   **Long-Running Applications:** For long-running applications, use a keytab or ticket cache for automatic token renewal to avoid issues with maximum delegation token lifetime. This is supported on YARN and Kubernetes.\n",
      "*   **Event Logging:** If using event logging, ensure the directory where event logs are stored (`spark.eventLog.dir`) has proper permissions.\n",
      "*   **Driver Logs in Client Mode:** If persisting driver logs in client mode, ensure the directory where the driver logs go (`spark.driver.log.dfsDir`) is created manually with proper permissions.\n",
      "*   **Standalone Mode:** For clusters using the standalone resource manager, access to the hosts and ports used by Spark services should be limited to origin hosts that need to access the services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, remember to secure the log files by setting the directory permissions to `drwxrwxrwxt` and setting the owner and group of the directory to correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server. This allows all users to write to the directory but prevents unprivileged users from reading, removing, or renaming a file unless they own it.\n"

For example, clicking an image gallery switches the active image. In React, data that changes over time is called state. You can add state to any component, and update it as needed. In this chapter, you\\'ll learn how to write components that handle interactions, update their state, and display different output over time.\\n\\nHow to handle user-initiated events\\n\\nHow to make components \"remember\" information with state\\n\\nHow React updates the UI in two phases\\n\\nWhy state doesn\\'t update right after you change it\\n\\nHow to queue multiple state updates\\n\\nHow to update an object in state\\n\\nHow to update an array in state\\n\\nResponding to events {/responding-to-events/}\\n\\nReact lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to user interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and so on.\\n\\nBuilt-in components like <button> only support built-in browser events like onClick. However, you can also create your own components, and give their event handler props any application-specific names that you like.\\n\\n```js export default function App() { return (\\n\\nfunction Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) { return (\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( ); } ```\\n\\ncss button { margin-right: 10px; }\\n\\nRead Responding to Events to learn how to add event handlers.\\n\\nState: a component\\'s memory {/state-a-components-memory/}\\n\\nComponents often need to change what\\'s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking \"next\" on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking \"buy\" puts a product in the shopping cart. Components need to \"remember\" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.\\n\\nYou can add state to a component with a useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features). The useState Hook lets you declare a state variable. It takes the initial state and returns a pair of values: the current state, and a state setter function that lets you update it.\\n\\njs const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);\\n\\nHere is how an image gallery uses and updates state on click:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import { sculptureList } from \\'./data.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Gallery() { const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false); const hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;\\n\\nfunction handleNextClick() { if (hasNext) { setIndex(index + 1); } else { setIndex(0); } }\\n\\nfunction handleMoreClick() { setShowMore(!showMore); }\\n\\nlet sculpture = sculptureList[index]; return ( <>\\n\\n{sculpture.name} by {sculpture.artist}\\n\\n({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})\\n\\n{showMore &&\\n\\n{sculpture.description}\\n\\n{sculpture.alt}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\njs src/data.js export const sculptureList = [{ name: \\'Homenaje a la Neurocirugía\\', artist: \\'Marta Colvin Andrade\\', description: \\'Although Colvin is predominantly known for abstract themes that allude to pre-Hispanic symbols, this gigantic sculpture, an homage to neurosurgery, is one of her most recognizable public art pieces.\\', url: \\'https://i.imgur.com/Mx7dA2Y.jpg\\', alt: \\'A bronze statue of two crossed hands delicately holding a human brain in their fingertips.\\' }, { name: \\'Floralis Genérica\\', artist: \\'Eduardo Catalano\\', description: \\'This enormous (75 ft. or 23m) silver flower is located in Buenos Aires.

Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.\\n\\nImagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:\\n\\nTriggering a render (delivering the diner\\'s order to the kitchen)\\n\\nRendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)\\n\\nCommitting to the DOM (placing the order on the table)\\n\\nRead Render and Commit to learn the lifecycle of a UI update.\\n\\nState as a snapshot {/state-as-a-snapshot/}\\n\\nUnlike regular JavaScript variables, React state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render. This can be surprising at first!\\n\\njs console.log(count); // 0 setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1 console.log(count); // Still 0!\\n\\nThis behavior helps you avoid subtle bugs. Here is a little chat app. Try to guess what happens if you press \"Send\" first and then change the recipient to Bob. Whose name will appear in the alert five seconds later?\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [to, setTo] = useState(\\'Alice\\'); const [message, setMessage] = useState(\\'Hello\\');\\n\\nfunction handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setTimeout(() => { alert(You said ${message} to ${to}); }, 5000); }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss label, textarea { margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; }\\n\\nRead State as a Snapshot to learn why state appears \"fixed\" and unchanging inside the event handlers.\\n\\nQueueing a series of state updates {/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates/}\\n\\nThis component is buggy: clicking \"+3\" increments the score only once.\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\\n\\nfunction increment() { setScore(score + 1); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nScore: {score}\\n\\n) } ```\\n\\ncss button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }\\n\\nState as a Snapshot explains why this is happening. Setting state requests a new re-render, but does not change it in the already running code. So score continues to be 0 right after you call setScore(score + 1).\\n\\njs console.log(score); // 0 setScore(score + 1); // setScore(0 + 1); console.log(score); // 0 setScore(score + 1); // setScore(0 + 1); console.log(score); // 0 setScore(score + 1); // setScore(0 + 1); console.log(score); // 0\\n\\nYou can fix this by passing an updater function when setting state. Notice how replacing setScore(score + 1) with setScore(s => s + 1) fixes the \"+3\" button. This lets you queue multiple state updates.\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\\n\\nfunction increment() { setScore(s => s + 1); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nScore: {score}\\n\\n) } ```\\n\\ncss button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }\\n\\nRead Queueing a Series of State Updates to learn how to queue a sequence of state updates.\\n\\nUpdating objects in state {/updating-objects-in-state/}\\n\\nState can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn\\'t change objects and arrays that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object and array, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then update the state to use that copy.\\n\\nUsually, you will use the ... spread syntax to copy objects and arrays that you want to change. For example, updating a nested object could look like this:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [person, setPerson] = useState({ name: \\'Niki de Saint Phalle\\', artwork: { title: \\'Blue Nana\\', city: \\'Hamburg\\', image: \\'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg\\', } });\\n\\nfunction handleNameChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, name: e.target.value }); }\\n\\nfunction handleTitleChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, artwork: { ...person.artwork, title: e.target.value } }); }\\n\\nfunction handleCityChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, artwork: { ...person.artwork, city: e.target.value } }); }\\n\\nfunction handleImageChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, artwork: { ...person.artwork, image: e.target.value } }); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\n{person.artwork.title} {\\' by \\'} {person.name} (located in {person.artwork.city})\\n\\n{person.artwork.title}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; } input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; } img { width: 200px; height: 200px; }\\n\\nIf copying objects in code gets tedious, you can use a library like Immer to reduce repetitive code:\\n\\n```js import { useImmer } from \\'use-immer\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [person, updatePerson] = useImmer({ name: \\'Niki de Saint Phalle\\', artwork: { title: \\'Blue Nana\\', city: \\'Hamburg\\', image: \\'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg\\', } });\\n\\nfunction handleNameChange(e) { updatePerson(draft => { draft.name = e.target.value; }); }\\n\\nfunction handleTitleChange(e) { updatePerson(draft => { draft.artwork.title = e.target.value; }); }\\n\\nfunction handleCityChange(e) { updatePerson(draft => { draft.artwork.city = e.target.value; }); }\\n\\nfunction handleImageChange(e) { updatePerson(draft => { draft.artwork.image = e.target.value; }); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\n{person.artwork.title} {\\' by \\'} {person.name} (located in {person.artwork.city})\\n\\n{person.artwork.title}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\njson package.json { \"dependencies\": { \"immer\": \"1.7.3\", \"react\": \"latest\", \"react-dom\": \"latest\", \"react-scripts\": \"latest\", \"use-immer\": \"0.5.1\" }, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts start\", \"build\": \"react-scripts build\", \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" } }\\n\\ncss label { display: block; } input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; } img { width: 200px; height: 200px; }\\n\\nRead Updating Objects in State to learn how to update objects correctly.\\n\\nUpdating arrays in state {/updating-arrays-in-state/}\\n\\nArrays are another type of mutable JavaScript objects you can store in state and should treat as read-only.

      "('react/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state.md', 'title: Reacting to Input with State\\n\\nReact provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly, you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input. This is similar to how designers think about the UI.\\n\\nHow declarative UI programming differs from imperative UI programming\\n\\nHow to enumerate the different visual states your component can be in\\n\\nHow to trigger the changes between the different visual states from code\\n\\nHow declarative UI compares to imperative {/how-declarative-ui-compares-to-imperative/}\\n\\nWhen you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI changes in response to user actions. Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:\\n\\nWhen you type something into the form, the \"Submit\" button becomes enabled.\\n\\nWhen you press \"Submit\", both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears.\\n\\nIf the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the \"Thank you\" message appears.\\n\\nIf the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again.\\n\\nIn imperative programming, the above corresponds directly to how you implement interaction. You have to write the exact instructions to manipulate the UI depending on what just happened. Here\\'s another way to think about this: imagine riding next to someone in a car and telling them turn by turn where to go.\\n\\nThey don\\'t know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It\\'s called imperative because you have to \"command\" each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer how to update the UI.\\n\\nIn this example of imperative UI programming, the form is built without React. It only uses the browser DOM:\\n\\n```js src/index.js active async function handleFormSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); disable(textarea); disable(button); show(loadingMessage); hide(errorMessage); try { await submitForm(textarea.value); show(successMessage); hide(form); } catch (err) { show(errorMessage); errorMessage.textContent = err.message; } finally { hide(loadingMessage); enable(textarea); enable(button); } }\\n\\nfunction handleTextareaChange() { if (textarea.value.length === 0) { disable(button); } else { enable(button); } }\\n\\nfunction hide(el) { el.style.display = \\'none\\'; }\\n\\nfunction show(el) { el.style.display = \\'\\'; }\\n\\nfunction enable(el) { el.disabled = false; }\\n\\nfunction disable(el) { el.disabled = true; }\\n\\nfunction submitForm(answer) { // Pretend it\\'s hitting the network. return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { if (answer.toLowerCase() === \\'istanbul\\') { resolve(); } else { reject(new Error(\\'Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!\\')); } }, 1500); }); }\\n\\nlet form = document.getElementById(\\'form\\'); let textarea = document.getElementById(\\'textarea\\'); let button = document.getElementById(\\'button\\'); let loadingMessage = document.getElementById(\\'loading\\'); let errorMessage = document.getElementById(\\'error\\'); let successMessage = document.getElementById(\\'success\\'); form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit; textarea.oninput = handleTextareaChange; ```\\n\\njs sandbox.config.json hidden { \"hardReloadOnChange\": true }\\n\\n```html public/index.html\\n\\nThat\\'s right!\\n\\n```\\n\\nManipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven\\'t introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something).\\n\\nReact was built to solve this problem.\\n\\nIn React, you don\\'t directly manipulate the UI--meaning you don\\'t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It\\'s the driver\\'s job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven\\'t considered!\\n\\nThinking about UI declaratively {/thinking-about-ui-declaratively/}\\n\\nYou\\'ve seen how to implement a form imperatively above. To better understand how to think in React, you\\'ll walk through reimplementing this UI in React below:\\n\\nIdentify your component\\'s different visual states\\n\\nDetermine what triggers those state changes\\n\\nRepresent the state in memory using useState\\n\\nRemove any non-essential state variables\\n\\nConnect the event handlers to set the state\\n\\nStep 1: Identify your component\\'s different visual states {/step-1-identify-your-components-different-visual-states/}\\n\\nIn computer science, you may hear about a \"state machine\" being in one of several “states”. If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different \"visual states\". React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.\\n\\nFirst, you need to visualize all the different \"states\" of the UI the user might see:\\n\\nEmpty: Form has a disabled \"Submit\" button.\\n\\nTyping: Form has an enabled \"Submit\" button.\\n\\nSubmitting: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.\\n\\nSuccess: \"Thank you\" message is shown instead of a form.\\n\\nError: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.\\n\\nJust like a designer, you\\'ll want to \"mock up\" or create \"mocks\" for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called status with a default value of \\'empty\\':\\n\\njs export default function Form({ status = \\'empty\\' }) { if (status === \\'success\\') { return <h1>That\\'s right!</h1> } return ( <> <h2>City quiz</h2> <p> In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water? </p> <form> <textarea /> <br /> <button> Submit </button> </form> ) }\\n\\nYou could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important. Try editing status = \\'empty\\' to status = \\'success\\' to see the success message appear. Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI before you wire up any logic. Here is a more fleshed out prototype of the same component, still \"controlled\" by the status prop:\\n\\njs export default function Form({ // Try \\'submitting\\', \\'error\\', \\'success\\': status = \\'empty\\' }) { if (status === \\'success\\') { return <h1>That\\'s right!</h1> } return ( <> <h2>City quiz</h2> <p> In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water? </p> <form> <textarea disabled={ status === \\'submitting\\' } /> <br /> <button disabled={ status === \\'empty\\' || status === \\'submitting\\' }> Submit </button> {status === \\'error\\' && <p className=\"Error\"> Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again! </p> } </form> ); }\\n\\ncss .Error { color: red; }\\n\\nDisplaying many visual states at once {/displaying-many-visual-states-at-once/}\\n\\nIf a component has a lot of visual states, it can be convenient to show them all on one page:\\n\\n```js src/App.js active import Form from \\'./Form.js\\';\\n\\nlet statuses = [ \\'empty\\', \\'typing\\', \\'submitting\\', \\'success\\', \\'error\\', ];\\n\\nexport default function App() { return ( <> {statuses.map(status => (\\n\\nForm ({status}):\\n\\n))} ); } ```\\n\\njs src/Form.js export default function Form({ status }) { if (status === \\'success\\') { return <h1>That\\'s right!</h1> } return ( <form> <textarea disabled={ status === \\'submitting\\' } /> <br /> <button disabled={ status === \\'empty\\' || status === \\'submitting\\' }> Submit </button> {status === \\'error\\' && <p className=\"Error\"> Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again! </p> } </form> ); }\\n\\ncss section { border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 20px; } h4 { color: #222; } body { margin: 0; } .Error { color: red; }\\n\\nPages like this are often called \"living styleguides\" or \"storybooks\".\\n\\nStep 2: Determine what triggers those state changes {/step-2-determine-what-triggers-those-state-changes/}\\n\\nYou can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:\\n\\nHuman inputs, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.\\n\\nComputer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.\\n\\nIn both cases, you must set state variables to update the UI. For the form you\\'re developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:\\n\\nChanging the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.\\n\\nClicking the Submit button (human) should switch it to the Submitting state.\\n\\nSuccessful network response (computer) should switch it to the Success state.\\n\\nFailed network response (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching error message.\\n\\nNotice that human inputs often require event handlers!\\n\\nTo help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long before implementation.\\n\\nForm states\\n\\nStep 3: Represent the state in memory with useState {/step-3-represent-the-state-in-memory-with-usestate/}\\n\\nNext you\\'ll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with useState. Simplicity is key: each piece of state is a \"moving piece\", and you want as few \"moving pieces\" as possible. More complexity leads to more bugs!\\n\\nStart with the state that absolutely must be there. For example, you\\'ll need to store the answer for the input, and the error (if it exists) to store the last error:\\n\\njs const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(\\'\\'); const [error, setError] = useState(null);\\n\\nThen, you\\'ll need a state variable representing which one of the visual states that you want to display. There\\'s usually more than a single way to represent that in memory, so you\\'ll need to experiment with it.\\n\\nIf you struggle to think of the best way immediately, start by adding enough state that you\\'re definitely sure that all the possible visual states are covered:\\n\\njs const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true); const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false); const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false); const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false); const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);\\n\\nYour first idea likely won\\'t be the best, but that\\'s ok--refactoring state is a part of the process!\\n\\nStep 4: Remove any non-essential state variables {/step-4-remove-any-non-essential-state-variables/}\\n\\nYou want to avoid duplication in the state content so you\\'re only tracking what is essential. Spending a little time on refactoring your state structure will make your components easier to understand, reduce duplication, and avoid unintended meanings. Your goal is to prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn\\'t represent any valid UI that you\\'d want a user to see. (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won\\'t be able to correct the error!)\\n\\nHere are some questions you can ask about your state variables:\\n\\nDoes this state cause a paradox? For example, isTyping and isSubmitting can\\'t both be true. A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the \"impossible\" state, you can combine these into a status that must be one of three values: \\'typing\\', \\'submitting\\', or \\'success\\'.\\n\\nIs the same information available in another state variable already? Another paradox: isEmpty and isTyping can\\'t be true at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove isEmpty and instead check answer.length === 0.\\n\\nCan you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable? isError is not needed because you can check error !== null instead.\\n\\nAfter this clean-up, you\\'re left with 3 (down from 7!) essential state variables:\\n\\njs const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(\\'\\'); const [error, setError] = useState(null); const [status, setStatus] = useState(\\'typing\\'); // \\'typing\\', \\'submitting\\', or \\'success\\'\\n\\nYou know they are essential, because you can\\'t remove any of them without breaking the functionality.\\n\\nEliminating “impossible” states with a reducer {/eliminating-impossible-states-with-a-reducer/}\\n\\nThese three variables are a good enough representation of this form\\'s state. However, there are still some intermediate states that don\\'t fully make sense. For example, a non-null error doesn\\'t make sense when status is \\'success\\'. To model the state more precisely, you can extract it into a reducer. Reducers let you unify multiple state variables into a single object and consolidate all the related logic!\\n\\nStep 5: Connect the event handlers to set state {/step-5-connect-the-event-handlers-to-set-state/}\\n\\nLastly, create event handlers that update the state. Below is the final form, with all event handlers wired up:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(\\'\\'); const [error, setError] = useState(null); const [status, setStatus] = useState(\\'typing\\');\\n\\nif (status === \\'success\\') { return\\n\\nThat\\'s right!\\n\\nasync function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setStatus(\\'submitting\\'); try { await submitForm(answer); setStatus(\\'success\\'); } catch (err) { setStatus(\\'typing\\'); setError(err); } }\\n\\nfunction handleTextareaChange(e) { setAnswer(e.target.value); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nCity quiz\\n\\nIn which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction submitForm(answer) { // Pretend it\\'s hitting the network. return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== \\'lima\\' if (shouldError) { reject(new Error(\\'Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!\\')); } else { resolve(); } }, 1500); }); } ```\\n\\ncss .Error { color: red; }\\n\\nAlthough this code is longer than the original imperative example, it is much less fragile. Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself.\\n\\nDeclarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative).\\n\\nWhen developing a component:\\n\\nIdentify all its visual states.\\n\\nDetermine the human and computer triggers for state changes.\\n\\nModel the state with useState.\\n\\nRemove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.\\n\\nConnect the event handlers to set state.\\n\\nAdd and remove a CSS class {/add-and-remove-a-css-class/}\\n\\nMake it so that clicking on the picture removes the background--active CSS class from the outer <div>, but adds the picture--active class to the <img>. Clicking the background again should restore the original CSS classes.\\n\\nVisually, you should expect that clicking on the picture removes the purple background and highlights the picture border. Clicking outside the picture highlights the background, but removes the picture border highlight.\\n\\njs export default function Picture() { return ( <div className=\"background background--active\"> <img className=\"picture\" alt=\"Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg\" /> </div> ); }\\n\\n```css body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }\\n\\n.background { width: 100vw; height: 100vh; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; background: #eee; }\\n\\n.background--active { background: #a6b5ff; }\\n\\n.picture { width: 200px; height: 200px; border-radius: 10px; border: 5px solid transparent; }\\n\\n.picture--active { border: 5px solid #a6b5ff; } ```\\n\\nThis component has two visual states: when the image is active, and when the image is inactive:\\n\\nWhen the image is active, the CSS classes are background and picture picture--active.\\n\\nWhen the image is inactive, the CSS classes are background background--active and picture.\\n\\nA single boolean state variable is enough to remember whether the image is active. The original task was to remove or add CSS classes. However, in React you need to describe what you want to see rather than manipulate the UI elements. So you need to calculate both CSS classes based on the current state. You also need to stop the propagation so that clicking the image doesn\\'t register as a click on the background.\\n\\nVerify that this version works by clicking the image and then outside of it:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Picture() { const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet backgroundClassName = \\'background\\'; let pictureClassName = \\'picture\\'; if (isActive) { pictureClassName += \\' picture--active\\'; } else { backgroundClassName += \\' background--active\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetIsActive(false)} >\\n\\n{ e.stopPropagation(); setIsActive(true); }} className={pictureClassName} alt=\"Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg\" />\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }\\n\\n.background { width: 100vw; height: 100vh; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; background: #eee; }\\n\\n.background--active { background: #a6b5ff; }\\n\\n.picture { width: 200px; height: 200px; border-radius: 10px; border: 5px solid transparent; }\\n\\n.picture--active { border: 5px solid #a6b5ff; } ```\\n\\nAlternatively, you could return two separate chunks of JSX:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Picture() { const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false); if (isActive) { return (\\n\\nsetIsActive(false)} >\\n\\nRainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia\\n\\ne.stopPropagation()} />\\n\\n); } return (\\n\\nRainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia\\n\\nsetIsActive(true)} />\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }\\n\\n.background { width: 100vw; height: 100vh; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; background: #eee; }\\n\\n.background--active { background: #a6b5ff; }\\n\\n.picture { width: 200px; height: 200px; border-radius: 10px; border: 5px solid transparent; }\\n\\n.picture--active { border: 5px solid #a6b5ff; } ```\\n\\nKeep in mind that if two different JSX chunks describe the same tree, their nesting (first <div> → first <img>) has to line up. Otherwise, toggling isActive would recreate the whole tree below and reset its state. This is why, if a similar JSX tree gets returned in both cases, it is better to write them as a single piece of JSX.\\n\\nProfile editor {/profile-editor/}\\n\\nHere is a small form implemented with plain JavaScript and DOM. Play with it to understand its behavior:\\n\\n```js src/index.js active function handleFormSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); if (editButton.textContent === \\'Edit Profile\\') { editButton.textContent = \\'Save Profile\\'; hide(firstNameText); hide(lastNameText); show(firstNameInput); show(lastNameInput); } else { editButton.textContent = \\'Edit Profile\\'; hide(firstNameInput); hide(lastNameInput); show(firstNameText); show(lastNameText); } }\\n\\nfunction handleFirstNameChange() { firstNameText.textContent = firstNameInput.value; helloText.textContent = ( \\'Hello \\' + firstNameInput.value + \\' \\' + lastNameInput.value + \\'!\\' ); }\\n\\nfunction handleLastNameChange() { lastNameText.textContent = lastNameInput.value; helloText.textContent = ( \\'Hello \\' + firstNameInput.value + \\' \\' + lastNameInput.value + \\'!\\' ); }\\n\\nfunction hide(el) { el.style.display = \\'none\\'; }\\n\\nfunction show(el) { el.style.display = \\'\\'; }\\n\\nlet form = document.getElementById(\\'form\\'); let editButton = document.getElementById(\\'editButton\\'); let firstNameInput = document.getElementById(\\'firstNameInput\\'); let firstNameText = document.getElementById(\\'firstNameText\\'); let lastNameInput = document.getElementById(\\'lastNameInput\\'); let lastNameText = document.getElementById(\\'lastNameText\\'); let helloText = document.getElementById(\\'helloText\\'); form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit; firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange; lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange; ```\\n\\njs sandbox.config.json hidden { \"hardReloadOnChange\": true }\\n\\n```html public/index.html\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis form switches between two modes: in the editing mode, you see the inputs, and in the viewing mode, you only see the result. The button label changes between \"Edit\" and \"Save\" depending on the mode you\\'re in. When you change the inputs, the welcome message at the bottom updates in real time.\\n\\nYour task is to reimplement it in React in the sandbox below. For your convenience, the markup was already converted to JSX, but you\\'ll need to make it show and hide the inputs like the original does.\\n\\nMake sure that it updates the text at the bottom, too!\\n\\njs export default function EditProfile() { return ( <form> <label> First name:{\\' \\'} <b>Jane</b> <input /> </label> <label> Last name:{\\' \\'} <b>Jacobs</b> <input /> </label> <button type=\"submit\"> Edit Profile </button> <p><i>Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p> </form> ); }\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }\\n\\nYou will need two state variables to hold the input values: firstName and lastName. You\\'re also going to need an isEditing state variable that holds whether to display the inputs or not. You should not need a fullName variable because the full name can always be calculated from the firstName and the lastName.\\n\\nFinally, you should use conditional rendering to show or hide the inputs depending on isEditing.\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function EditProfile() { const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false); const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'Jane\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'Jacobs\\');\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }\\n\\nCompare this solution to the original imperative code. How are they different?\\n\\nRefactor the imperative solution without React {/refactor-the-imperative-solution-without-react/}\\n\\nHere is the original sandbox from the previous challenge, written imperatively without React:\\n\\n```js src/index.js active function handleFormSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); if (editButton.textContent === \\'Edit Profile\\') { editButton.textContent = \\'Save Profile\\'; hide(firstNameText); hide(lastNameText); show(firstNameInput); show(lastNameInput); } else { editButton.textContent = \\'Edit Profile\\'; hide(firstNameInput); hide(lastNameInput); show(firstNameText); show(lastNameText); } }\\n\\nfunction handleFirstNameChange() { firstNameText.textContent = firstNameInput.value; helloText.textContent = ( \\'Hello \\' + firstNameInput.value + \\' \\' + lastNameInput.value + \\'!\\' ); }\\n\\nfunction handleLastNameChange() { lastNameText.textContent = lastNameInput.value; helloText.textContent = ( \\'Hello \\' + firstNameInput.value + \\' \\' + lastNameInput.value + \\'!\\' ); }\\n\\nfunction hide(el) { el.style.display = \\'none\\'; }\\n\\nfunction show(el) { el.style.display = \\'\\'; }\\n\\nlet form = document.getElementById(\\'form\\'); let editButton = document.getElementById(\\'editButton\\'); let firstNameInput = document.getElementById(\\'firstNameInput\\'); let firstNameText = document.getElementById(\\'firstNameText\\'); let lastNameInput = document.getElementById(\\'lastNameInput\\'); let lastNameText = document.getElementById(\\'lastNameText\\'); let helloText = document.getElementById(\\'helloText\\'); form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit; firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange; lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange; ```\\n\\njs sandbox.config.json hidden { \"hardReloadOnChange\": true }\\n\\n```html public/index.html\\n\\n```\\n\\nImagine React didn\\'t exist. Can you refactor this code in a way that makes the logic less fragile and more similar to the React version? What would it look like if the state was explicit, like in React?\\n\\nIf you\\'re struggling to think where to start, the stub below already has most of the structure in place.

That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.\\n\\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the createHandle code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your createHandle function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.\\n\\nStarting with React 19, ref is available as a prop.

However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component:\\n\\n```js {4-8} import { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) { useImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { // ... your methods ... }; }, []);\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n; }; ```\\n\\nNote that in the code above, the ref is no longer passed to the <input>.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you don't want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:\\n\\n```js {7-14} import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) { const inputRef = useRef(null);\\n\\nuseImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { focus() { inputRef.current.focus(); }, scrollIntoView() { inputRef.current.scrollIntoView(); }, }; }, []);\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n; }; ```\\n\\nNow, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput, it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it.

For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button:\\n\\n```js import { useRef } from 'react'; import Post from './Post.js';\\n\\nexport default function Page() { const postRef = useRef(null);\\n\\nfunction handleClick() { postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment(); }\\n\\nreturn ( <> ); } ```\\n\\n```js src/Post.js import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react'; import CommentList from './CommentList.js'; import AddComment from './AddComment.js';\\n\\nfunction Post({ ref }) { const commentsRef = useRef(null); const addCommentRef = useRef(null);\\n\\nuseImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { scrollAndFocusAddComment() { commentsRef.current.scrollToBottom(); addCommentRef.current.focus(); } }; }, []);\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nWelcome to my blog!\\n\\n); };\\n\\nexport default Post; ```\\n\\n```js src/CommentList.js import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction CommentList({ ref }) { const divRef = useRef(null);\\n\\nuseImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { scrollToBottom() { const node = divRef.current; node.scrollTop = node.scrollHeight; } }; }, []);\\n\\nlet comments = []; for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { comments.push(\\n\\nComment #{i}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n{comments}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nexport default CommentList; ```\\n\\n```js src/AddComment.js import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction AddComment({ ref }) { return\\n\\n; }\\n\\nexport default AddComment; ```\\n\\ncss .CommentList { height: 100px; overflow: scroll; border: 1px solid black; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; }\\n\\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can't express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\\n\\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\", 0.5908231142339597)\n",

For example, you won\\'t write commands like \"disable the button\", \"enable the button\", \"show the success message\", etc. Instead, you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (\"initial state\", \"typing state\", \"success state\"), and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is similar to how designers think about UI.\\n\\nHere is a quiz form built using React. Note how it uses the status state variable to determine whether to enable or disable the submit button, and whether to show the success message instead.\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(\\'\\'); const [error, setError] = useState(null); const [status, setStatus] = useState(\\'typing\\');\\n\\nif (status === \\'success\\') { return\\n\\nThat\\'s right!\\n\\nasync function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setStatus(\\'submitting\\'); try { await submitForm(answer); setStatus(\\'success\\'); } catch (err) { setStatus(\\'typing\\'); setError(err); } }\\n\\nfunction handleTextareaChange(e) { setAnswer(e.target.value); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nCity quiz\\n\\nIn which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction submitForm(answer) { // Pretend it\\'s hitting the network. return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== \\'lima\\' if (shouldError) { reject(new Error(\\'Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!\\')); } else { resolve(); } }, 1500); }); } ```\\n\\ncss .Error { color: red; }\\n\\nRead Reacting to Input with State to learn how to approach interactions with a state-driven mindset.\\n\\nChoosing the state structure {/choosing-the-state-structure/}\\n\\nStructuring state well can make a difference between a component that is pleasant to modify and debug, and one that is a constant source of bugs. The most important principle is that state shouldn\\'t contain redundant or duplicated information. If there\\'s unnecessary state, it\\'s easy to forget to update it, and introduce bugs!\\n\\nFor example, this form has a redundant fullName state variable:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(\\'\\');\\n\\nfunction handleFirstNameChange(e) { setFirstName(e.target.value); setFullName(e.target.value + \\' \\' + lastName); }\\n\\nfunction handleLastNameChange(e) { setLastName(e.target.value); setFullName(firstName + \\' \\' + e.target.value); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nLet’s check you in\\n\\nYour ticket will be issued to: {fullName}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; }\\n\\nYou can remove it and simplify the code by calculating fullName while the component is rendering:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'\\');\\n\\nconst fullName = firstName + \\' \\' + lastName;\\n\\nfunction handleFirstNameChange(e) { setFirstName(e.target.value); }\\n\\nfunction handleLastNameChange(e) { setLastName(e.target.value); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nLet’s check you in\\n\\nYour ticket will be issued to: {fullName}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; }\\n\\nThis might seem like a small change, but many bugs in React apps are fixed this way.\\n\\nRead Choosing the State Structure to learn how to design the state shape to avoid bugs.\\n\\nSharing state between components {/sharing-state-between-components/}\\n\\nSometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as \"lifting state up\", and it\\'s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.\\n\\nIn this example, only one panel should be active at a time. To achieve this, instead of keeping the active state inside each individual panel, the parent component holds the state and specifies the props for its children.\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Accordion() { const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0); return ( <>\\n\\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Panel({ title, children, isActive, onShow }) { return (\\n\\n{title}\\n\\n{isActive ? (\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n) : ( )}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss h3, p { margin: 5px 0px; } .panel { padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #aaa; }\\n\\nRead Sharing State Between Components to learn how to lift state up and keep components in sync.\\n\\nPreserving and resetting state {/preserving-and-resetting-state/}\\n\\nWhen you re-render a component, React needs to decide which parts of the tree to keep (and update), and which parts to discard or re-create from scratch. In most cases, React\\'s automatic behavior works well enough. By default, React preserves the parts of the tree that \"match up\" with the previously rendered component tree.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes this is not what you want. In this chat app, typing a message and then switching the recipient does not reset the input. This can make the user accidentally send a message to the wrong person:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst contacts = [ { name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ selectedContact, contacts, onSelect }) { return ( <section className=\"contact-list\"> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.email}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact); }}> {contact.name} </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/Chat.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Chat({ contact }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss .chat, .contact-list { float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; } ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li button { width: 100px; padding: 10px; margin-right: 10px; } textarea { height: 150px; }\\n\\nReact lets you override the default behavior, and force a component to reset its state by passing it a different key, like <Chat key={email} />. This tells React that if the recipient is different, it should be considered a different Chat component that needs to be re-created from scratch with the new data (and UI like inputs). Now switching between the recipients resets the input field--even though you render the same component.\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst contacts = [ { name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ selectedContact, contacts, onSelect }) { return ( <section className=\"contact-list\"> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.email}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact); }}> {contact.name} </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/Chat.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Chat({ contact }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss .chat, .contact-list { float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; } ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li button { width: 100px; padding: 10px; margin-right: 10px; } textarea { height: 150px; }\\n\\nRead Preserving and Resetting State to learn the lifetime of state and how to control it.\\n\\nExtracting state logic into a reducer {/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer/}\\n\\nComponents with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called \"reducer\". Your event handlers become concise because they only specify the user \"actions\". At the bottom of the file, the reducer function specifies how the state should update in response to each action!\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useReducer } from \\'react\\'; import AddTask from \\'./AddTask.js\\'; import TaskList from \\'./TaskList.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function TaskApp() { const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer( tasksReducer, initialTasks );\\n\\nfunction handleAddTask(text) { dispatch({ type: \\'added\\', id: nextId++, text: text, }); }\\n\\nfunction handleChangeTask(task) { dispatch({ type: \\'changed\\', task: task }); }\\n\\nfunction handleDeleteTask(taskId) { dispatch({ type: \\'deleted\\', id: taskId }); }\\n\\nreturn ( <>\\n\\nPrague itinerary\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction tasksReducer(tasks, action) { switch (action.type) { case \\'added\\': { return [...tasks, { id: action.id, text: action.text, done: false }]; } case \\'changed\\': { return tasks.map(t => { if (t.id === action.task.id) { return action.task; } else { return t; } }); } case \\'deleted\\': { return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id); } default: { throw Error(\\'Unknown action: \\' + action.type); } } }\\n\\nlet nextId = 3; const initialTasks = [ { id: 0, text: \\'Visit Kafka Museum\\', done: true }, { id: 1, text: \\'Watch a puppet show\\', done: false }, { id: 2, text: \\'Lennon Wall pic\\', done: false } ]; ```\\n\\n```js src/AddTask.js hidden import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function AddTask({ onAddTask }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <>\\n\\nsetText(e.target.value)} /> ) } ```\\n\\n```js src/TaskList.js hidden import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function TaskList({ tasks, onChangeTask, onDeleteTask }) { return (\\n\\n{tasks.map(task => (\\n\\n))}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Task({ task, onChange, onDelete }) { const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false); let taskContent; if (isEditing) { taskContent = ( <>\\n\\n{ onChange({ ...task, text: e.target.value }); }} /> ); } else { taskContent = ( <> {task.text} ); } return ( ); } ```\\n\\ncss button { margin: 5px; } li { list-style-type: none; } ul, li { margin: 0; padding: 0; }\\n\\nRead Extracting State Logic into a Reducer to learn how to consolidate logic in the reducer function.\\n\\nPassing data deeply with context {/passing-data-deeply-with-context/}\\n\\nUsually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become inconvenient if you need to pass some prop through many components, or if many components need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep it is—without passing it explicitly through props.\\n\\nHere, the Heading component determines its heading level by \"asking\" the closest Section for its level. Each Section tracks its own level by asking the parent Section and adding one to it. Every Section provides information to all components below it without passing props--it does that through context.\\n\\n```js import Heading from \\'./Heading.js\\'; import Section from \\'./Section.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Page() { return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```js src/Section.js import { useContext } from \\'react\\'; import { LevelContext } from \\'./LevelContext.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Section({ children }) { const level = useContext(LevelContext); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```js src/Heading.js import { useContext } from \\'react\\'; import { LevelContext } from \\'./LevelContext.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Heading({ children }) { const level = useContext(LevelContext); switch (level) { case 0: throw Error(\\'Heading must be inside a Section!\\'); case 1: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; case 2: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; case 3: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; case 4: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; case 5: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; case 6: return\\n\\n{children}\\n\\n; default: throw Error(\\'Unknown level: \\' + level); } } ```\\n\\n```js src/LevelContext.js import { createContext } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport const LevelContext = createContext(0); ```\\n\\ncss .section { padding: 10px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #aaa; }\\n\\nRead Passing Data Deeply with Context to learn about using context as an alternative to passing props.\\n\\nScaling up with reducer and context {/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context/}\\n\\nReducers let you consolidate a component’s state update logic.

You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex screen.\\n\\nWith this approach, a parent component with complex state manages it with a reducer.

React keeps track of which state belongs to which component based on their place in the UI tree. You can control when to preserve state and when to reset it between re-renders.\\n\\nWhen React chooses to preserve or reset the state\\n\\nHow to force React to reset component\\'s state\\n\\nHow keys and types affect whether the state is preserved\\n\\nState is tied to a position in the render tree {/state-is-tied-to-a-position-in-the-tree/}\\n\\nReact builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.\\n\\nWhen you give a component state, you might think the state \"lives\" inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it\\'s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.\\n\\nHere, there is only one <Counter /> JSX tag, but it\\'s rendered at two different positions:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const counter = ; return (\\n\\n{counter} {counter}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nHere\\'s how these look as a tree:\\n\\nReact tree\\n\\nThese are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. You don\\'t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.\\n\\nIn React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two Counter components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, score and hover states.\\n\\nTry clicking both counters and notice they don\\'t affect each other:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { return (\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css .counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nAs you can see, when one counter is updated, only the state for that component is updated:\\n\\nUpdating state\\n\\nReact will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree. To see this, increment both counters, then remove the second component by unchecking \"Render the second counter\" checkbox, and then add it back by ticking it again:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [showB, setShowB] = useState(true); return (\\n\\n{showB && }\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nNotice how the moment you stop rendering the second counter, its state disappears completely. That\\'s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state.\\n\\nDeleting a component\\n\\nWhen you tick \"Render the second counter\", a second Counter and its state are initialized from scratch (score = 0) and added to the DOM.\\n\\nAdding a component\\n\\nReact preserves a component\\'s state for as long as it\\'s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.\\n\\nSame component at the same position preserves state {/same-component-at-the-same-position-preserves-state/}\\n\\nIn this example, there are two different <Counter /> tags:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false); return (\\n\\n{isFancy ? ( ) : ( )}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ isFancy }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; } if (isFancy) { className += \\' fancy\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.fancy { border: 5px solid gold; color: #ff6767; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nWhen you tick or clear the checkbox, the counter state does not get reset. Whether isFancy is true or false, you always have a <Counter /> as the first child of the div returned from the root App component:\\n\\nUpdating the App state does not reset the Counter because Counter stays in the same position\\n\\nIt\\'s the same component at the same position, so from React\\'s perspective, it\\'s the same counter.\\n\\nRemember that it\\'s the position in the UI tree--not in the JSX markup--that matters to React! This component has two return clauses with different <Counter /> JSX tags inside and outside the if:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false); if (isFancy) { return (\\n\\n); } return (\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ isFancy }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; } if (isFancy) { className += \\' fancy\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.fancy { border: 5px solid gold; color: #ff6767; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nYou might expect the state to reset when you tick checkbox, but it doesn\\'t! This is because both of these <Counter /> tags are rendered at the same position. React doesn\\'t know where you place the conditions in your function. All it \"sees\" is the tree you return.\\n\\nIn both cases, the App component returns a <div> with <Counter /> as a first child. To React, these two counters have the same \"address\": the first child of the first child of the root. This is how React matches them up between the previous and next renders, regardless of how you structure your logic.\\n\\nDifferent components at the same position reset state {/different-components-at-the-same-position-reset-state/}\\n\\nIn this example, ticking the checkbox will replace <Counter> with a <p>:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false); return (\\n\\n{isPaused ? (\\n\\nSee you later!\\n\\n) : ( )}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nHere, you switch between different component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of the <div> contained a Counter. But when you swapped in a p, React removed the Counter from the UI tree and destroyed its state.\\n\\nWhen Counter changes to p, the Counter is deleted and the p is added\\n\\nWhen switching back, the p is deleted and the Counter is added\\n\\nAlso, when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree. To see how this works, increment the counter and then tick the checkbox:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false); return (\\n\\n{isFancy ? (\\n\\n) : (\\n\\n)}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ isFancy }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; } if (isFancy) { className += \\' fancy\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css label { display: block; clear: both; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; }\\n\\n.fancy { border: 5px solid gold; color: #ff6767; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nThe counter state gets reset when you click the checkbox. Although you render a Counter, the first child of the div changes from a div to a section. When the child div was removed from the DOM, the whole tree below it (including the Counter and its state) was destroyed as well.\\n\\nWhen section changes to div, the section is deleted and the new div is added\\n\\nWhen switching back, the div is deleted and the new section is added\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to \"match up\" from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.\\n\\nThis is why you should not nest component function definitions.\\n\\nHere, the MyTextField component function is defined inside MyComponent:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function MyComponent() { const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\\n\\nfunction MyTextField() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\');\\n\\nreturn (\\n  <input\\n    value={text}\\n    onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\\n  />\\n);\\n\\nreturn ( <> ); } ```\\n\\nEvery time you click the button, the input state disappears! This is because a different MyTextField function is created for every render of MyComponent. You\\'re rendering a different component in the same position, so React resets all state below. This leads to bugs and performance problems. To avoid this problem, always declare component functions at the top level, and don\\'t nest their definitions.\\n\\nResetting state at the same position {/resetting-state-at-the-same-position/}\\n\\nBy default, React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. Usually, this is exactly what you want, so it makes sense as the default behavior. But sometimes, you may want to reset a component\\'s state. Consider this app that lets two players keep track of their scores during each turn:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Scoreboard() { const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true); return (\\n\\n{isPlayerA ? ( ) : ( )}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ person }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{person}\\'s score: {score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css h1 { font-size: 18px; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nCurrently, when you change the player, the score is preserved. The two Counters appear in the same position, so React sees them as the same Counter whose person prop has changed.\\n\\nBut conceptually, in this app they should be two separate counters. They might appear in the same place in the UI, but one is a counter for Taylor, and another is a counter for Sarah.\\n\\nThere are two ways to reset state when switching between them:\\n\\nRender components in different positions\\n\\nGive each component an explicit identity with key\\n\\nOption 1: Rendering a component in different positions {/option-1-rendering-a-component-in-different-positions/}\\n\\nIf you want these two Counters to be independent, you can render them in two different positions:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Scoreboard() { const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true); return (\\n\\n{isPlayerA && } {!isPlayerA && }\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ person }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{person}\\'s score: {score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css h1 { font-size: 18px; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nInitially, isPlayerA is true. So the first position contains Counter state, and the second one is empty.\\n\\nWhen you click the \"Next player\" button the first position clears but the second one now contains a Counter.\\n\\nInitial state\\n\\nClicking \"next\"\\n\\nClicking \"next\" again\\n\\nEach Counter\\'s state gets destroyed each time it\\'s removed from the DOM. This is why they reset every time you click the button.\\n\\nThis solution is convenient when you only have a few independent components rendered in the same place. In this example, you only have two, so it\\'s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX.\\n\\nOption 2: Resetting state with a key {/option-2-resetting-state-with-a-key/}\\n\\nThere is also another, more generic, way to reset a component\\'s state.\\n\\nYou might have seen keys when rendering lists. Keys aren\\'t just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (\"first counter\", \"second counter\") to discern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter--for example, Taylor\\'s counter. This way, React will know Taylor\\'s counter wherever it appears in the tree!\\n\\nIn this example, the two <Counter />s don\\'t share state even though they appear in the same place in JSX:\\n\\n```js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Scoreboard() { const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true); return (\\n\\n{isPlayerA ? ( ) : ( )}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Counter({ person }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\\n\\nlet className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\nsetHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} >\\n\\n{person}\\'s score: {score}\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\n```css h1 { font-size: 18px; }\\n\\n.counter { width: 100px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 4px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; }\\n\\n.hover { background: #ffffd8; } ```\\n\\nSwitching between Taylor and Sarah does not preserve the state. This is because you gave them different keys:\\n\\njs {isPlayerA ? ( <Counter key=\"Taylor\" person=\"Taylor\" /> ) : ( <Counter key=\"Sarah\" person=\"Sarah\" /> )}\\n\\nSpecifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed. Toggling between them resets their state over and over.\\n\\nRemember that keys are not globally unique. They only specify the position within the parent.\\n\\nResetting a form with a key {/resetting-a-form-with-a-key/}\\n\\nResetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms.\\n\\nIn this chat app, the <Chat> component contains the text input state:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst contacts = [ { id: 0, name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { id: 1, name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { id: 2, name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ selectedContact, contacts, onSelect }) { return ( <section className=\"contact-list\"> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.id}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact); }}> {contact.name} </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/Chat.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Chat({ contact }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss .chat, .contact-list { float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; } ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li button { width: 100px; padding: 10px; margin-right: 10px; } textarea { height: 150px; }\\n\\nTry entering something into the input, and then press \"Alice\" or \"Bob\" to choose a different recipient. You will notice that the input state is preserved because the <Chat> is rendered at the same position in the tree.\\n\\nIn many apps, this may be the desired behavior, but not in a chat app! You don\\'t want to let the user send a message they already typed to a wrong person due to an accidental click. To fix it, add a key:\\n\\njs <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />\\n\\nThis ensures that when you select a different recipient, the Chat component will be recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the DOM elements instead of reusing them.\\n\\nNow switching the recipient always clears the text field:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst contacts = [ { id: 0, name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { id: 1, name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { id: 2, name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ selectedContact, contacts, onSelect }) { return ( <section className=\"contact-list\"> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.id}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact); }}> {contact.name} </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/Chat.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function Chat({ contact }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss .chat, .contact-list { float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; } ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li button { width: 100px; padding: 10px; margin-right: 10px; } textarea { height: 150px; }\\n\\nPreserving state for removed components {/preserving-state-for-removed-components/}\\n\\nIn a real chat app, you\\'d probably want to recover the input state when the user selects the previous recipient again. There are a few ways to keep the state \"alive\" for a component that\\'s no longer visible:\\n\\nYou could render all chats instead of just the current one, but hide all the others with CSS. The chats would not get removed from the tree, so their local state would be preserved. This solution works great for simple UIs. But it can get very slow if the hidden trees are large and contain a lot of DOM nodes.\\n\\nYou could lift the state up and hold the pending message for each recipient in the parent component. This way, when the child components get removed, it doesn\\'t matter, because it\\'s the parent that keeps the important information. This is the most common solution.\\n\\nYou might also use a different source in addition to React state. For example, you probably want a message draft to persist even if the user accidentally closes the page. To implement this, you could have the Chat component initialize its state by reading from the localStorage, and save the drafts there too.\\n\\nNo matter which strategy you pick, a chat with Alice is conceptually distinct from a chat with Bob, so it makes sense to give a key to the <Chat> tree based on the current recipient.\\n\\nReact keeps state for as long as the same component is rendered at the same position.\\n\\nState is not kept in JSX tags. It\\'s associated with the tree position in which you put that JSX.\\n\\nYou can force a subtree to reset its state by giving it a different key.\\n\\nDon\\'t nest component definitions, or you\\'ll reset state by accident.\\n\\nFix disappearing input text {/fix-disappearing-input-text/}\\n\\nThis example shows a message when you press the button. However, pressing the button also accidentally resets the input. Why does this happen? Fix it so that pressing the button does not reset the input text.\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false); if (showHint) { return (\\n\\nHint: Your favorite city?\\n\\n); } return (\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Form() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\ncss textarea { display: block; margin: 10px 0; }\\n\\nThe problem is that Form is rendered in different positions. In the if branch, it is the second child of the <div>, but in the else branch, it is the first child. Therefore, the component type in each position changes. The first position changes between holding a p and a Form, while the second position changes between holding a Form and a button. React resets the state every time the component type changes.\\n\\nThe easiest solution is to unify the branches so that Form always renders in the same position:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false); return (\\n\\n{showHint &&\\n\\nHint: Your favorite city?\\n\\n{showHint ? ( ) : ( )}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Form() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\ncss textarea { display: block; margin: 10px 0; }\\n\\nTechnically, you could also add null before <Form /> in the else branch to match the if branch structure:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false); if (showHint) { return (\\n\\nHint: Your favorite city?\\n\\n); } return (\\n\\n{null}\\n\\n); }\\n\\nfunction Form() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return (\\n\\ncss textarea { display: block; margin: 10px 0; }\\n\\nThis way, Form is always the second child, so it stays in the same position and keeps its state. But this approach is much less obvious and introduces a risk that someone else will remove that null.\\n\\nSwap two form fields {/swap-two-form-fields/}\\n\\nThis form lets you enter first and last name. It also has a checkbox controlling which field goes first. When you tick the checkbox, the \"Last name\" field will appear before the \"First name\" field.\\n\\nIt almost works, but there is a bug. If you fill in the \"First name\" input and tick the checkbox, the text will stay in the first input (which is now \"Last name\"). Fix it so that the input text also moves when you reverse the order.\\n\\nIt seems like for these fields, their position within the parent is not enough. Is there some way to tell React how to match up the state between re-renders?\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [reverse, setReverse] = useState(false); let checkbox = ( ); if (reverse) { return ( <> {checkbox} ); } else { return ( <> {checkbox} ); } }\\n\\nfunction Field({ label }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( ); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin: 10px 0; }\\n\\nGive a key to both <Field> components in both if and else branches. This tells React how to \"match up\" the correct state for either <Field> even if their order within the parent changes:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function App() { const [reverse, setReverse] = useState(false); let checkbox = ( ); if (reverse) { return ( <> {checkbox} ); } else { return ( <> {checkbox} ); } }\\n\\nfunction Field({ label }) { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( ); } ```\\n\\ncss label { display: block; margin: 10px 0; }\\n\\nReset a detail form {/reset-a-detail-form/}\\n\\nThis is an editable contact list. You can edit the selected contact\\'s details and then either press \"Save\" to update it, or \"Reset\" to undo your changes.\\n\\nWhen you select a different contact (for example, Alice), the state updates but the form keeps showing the previous contact\\'s details. Fix it so that the form gets reset when the selected contact changes.\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\'; import EditContact from \\'./EditContact.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function ContactManager() { const [ contacts, setContacts ] = useState(initialContacts); const [ selectedId, setSelectedId ] = useState(0); const selectedContact = contacts.find(c => c.id === selectedId );\\n\\nfunction handleSave(updatedData) { const nextContacts = contacts.map(c => { if (c.id === updatedData.id) { return updatedData; } else { return c; } }); setContacts(nextContacts); }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst initialContacts = [ { id: 0, name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { id: 1, name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { id: 2, name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ contacts, selectedId, onSelect }) { return ( <section> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.id}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact.id); }}> {contact.id === selectedId ? <b>{contact.name}</b> : contact.name } </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/EditContact.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function EditContact({ initialData, onSave }) { const [name, setName] = useState(initialData.name); const [email, setEmail] = useState(initialData.email); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li { display: inline-block; } li button { padding: 10px; } label { display: block; margin: 10px 0; } button { margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; }\\n\\nGive key={selectedId} to the EditContact component. This way, switching between different contacts will reset the form:\\n\\n```js src/App.js import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\'; import EditContact from \\'./EditContact.js\\';\\n\\nexport default function ContactManager() { const [ contacts, setContacts ] = useState(initialContacts); const [ selectedId, setSelectedId ] = useState(0); const selectedContact = contacts.find(c => c.id === selectedId );\\n\\nfunction handleSave(updatedData) { const nextContacts = contacts.map(c => { if (c.id === updatedData.id) { return updatedData; } else { return c; } }); setContacts(nextContacts); }\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n) }\\n\\nconst initialContacts = [ { id: 0, name: \\'Taylor\\', email: \\'taylor@mail.com\\' }, { id: 1, name: \\'Alice\\', email: \\'alice@mail.com\\' }, { id: 2, name: \\'Bob\\', email: \\'bob@mail.com\\' } ]; ```\\n\\njs src/ContactList.js export default function ContactList({ contacts, selectedId, onSelect }) { return ( <section> <ul> {contacts.map(contact => <li key={contact.id}> <button onClick={() => { onSelect(contact.id); }}> {contact.id === selectedId ? <b>{contact.name}</b> : contact.name } </button> </li> )} </ul> </section> ); }\\n\\n```js src/EditContact.js import { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nexport default function EditContact({ initialData, onSave }) { const [name, setName] = useState(initialData.name); const [email, setEmail] = useState(initialData.email); return (\\n\\n); } ```\\n\\ncss ul, li { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li { display: inline-block; } li button { padding: 10px; } label { display: block; margin: 10px 0; } button { margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; }\\n\\nClear an image while it\\'s loading {/clear-an-image-while-its-loading/}\\n\\nWhen you press \"Next\", the browser starts loading the next image.
